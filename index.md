Hello, and welcome to my personal space to tinker and detail my findings as I explore ML.

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Lockheed Martin Space. I'm researching flow-based deep generative models and how they can be applied to complex-valued data to aid in anomaly detection and mitigation.

In the past I have spent time exploring diffusion-based approaches to closing the synthetic data gap when creating synthetic data for downstream model training. I interned on Twitter's Ads Targeting Modeling team where I trained models to better match users with their interests on industry scale datasets.
